# Javascript Manifests Lab

## Objectives

1. Create Javascript Manifest Files
2. Require Javascript Files in Manifests with Sprocket Directives
3. Include Javascript Manifest Files in Layouts

## Outline
Located in the lab repository is a simple Rails application called `javascript_manifest_rails`. Your job is to assemble two valid JavaScript manifest files, one for the Admin layout and one for the Application layout. There is also a file hidden somewhere that you will need to find and move to allow for loading.

### Application Layout
- Create an application manifest with 3 of the js files found throughout the application.
- Load your manifest into the application layout.

### Admin Layout
- Choose 2 new JS files that you didn't include in the application manifest and 1 that you did and create an admin manifest.
- Load your manifest into the admin layout. 
- Add an addition `javascript_include_tag` to the admin layout and load the final remaining JS file.

When you finish, start the rails server with `rails server` and browse to http://localhost:3000 for the Application layout and http://localhost:3000/admin for the Admin layout. If you open Chrome dev tools and go to the elements tab, you should see the files you included in your manifest files as script tags in the head tag.
